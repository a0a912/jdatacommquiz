Q1. A packet is traversing an internetwork from a source host to a destination host, passing through three intermediate routers. How many times will the destination link-layer address in the frame header be changed during this journey?
   A. It will be changed four times.
   B. It will not be changed at all.
   C. It will be changed three times.
   D. It will be changed once at the source.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This counts the initial transmission from the source host and each hop between the three routers and the final destination.

Q2. According to the source material, which data-link layer service is also mentioned as being primarily handled by the network and transport layers, but may be used by some wide-area networks?
   A. Flow Control
   B. Error Control
   C. Framing
   D. Congestion Control

   Answer: D
   Explanation: The text explicitly states this service is mainly a concern for higher layers but can be found in some data-link layer implementations, particularly for WANs.

Q3. A communication link is shared among several pairs of devices, meaning each device uses only a portion of the medium's capacity. Which data-link sublayer is specifically needed to manage issues arising from this type of link?
   A. Data Link Control (DLC) sublayer
   B. Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer
   C. Network Interface Control (NIC) sublayer
   D. Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text specifies that the MAC sublayer deals with issues unique to broadcast (shared) links.

Q4. A system transmits data at 5 Mbps over a medium where a noise event lasts for 1/500th of a second. Based on the relationship described in the text, this event would be classified as what type of error?
   A. A single-bit error, because the duration is very short.
   B. A burst error, because the noise duration affects multiple bits.
   C. A parity error, because the number of affected bits is even.
   D. A checksum error, as it involves a block of data.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The calculation reveals that 10,000 bits could be affected, which fits the definition of a burst error (2 or more bits).

Q5. In a block coding scheme, the dataword `10` is encoded as `101` and the dataword `11` is encoded as `110`. If the sender transmits `101` but the receiver receives `110`, what is the outcome?
   A. An error is detected, and the codeword is discarded.
   B. The receiver corrects the codeword back to `101`.
   C. The receiver extracts the incorrect dataword `11` without detecting an error.
   D. The receiver requests a retransmission from the sender.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This scenario illustrates a key weakness: if a transmission error transforms one valid codeword into another valid codeword, the error is undetectable.

Q6. A system uses an even parity-check code where 4-bit datawords are converted to 5-bit codewords. If the dataword `1101` is to be sent, what is the resulting codeword?
   A. 11010
   B. 11011
   C. 01101
   D. 11101

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This codeword has four '1's, which is an even number. The parity bit is correctly added to make the total count of '1's even.

Q7. In a parity-check code system, the codeword `10111` is sent. A two-bit error occurs, changing `a_3` and `r_0`, resulting in the received codeword `00110`. How does the receiver interpret this?
   A. It detects an error because the syndrome is 1.
   B. It detects an error and requests retransmission.
   C. It incorrectly accepts the data and creates the dataword `0011`.
   D. It detects a two-bit error and corrects it.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This code cannot detect an even number of errors. The receiver calculates a syndrome of 0 and extracts the corrupted dataword.

Q8. What is the defining characteristic of a cyclic code that is not necessarily true for all linear block codes?
   A. The XOR of any two valid codewords creates another valid codeword.
   B. A generator polynomial is used to create the codewords.
   C. If a codeword is cyclically shifted, the result is another valid codeword.
   D. A checksum is appended to the dataword to form the codeword.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text explicitly defines this extra property—rotational invariance—as the key differentiator for cyclic codes.

Q9. Using the one's complement checksum method described in the text, what is the final checksum value that the sender calculates and sends for the 4-bit numbers (7, 11, 12, 0, 6)?
   A. 6
   B. 36
   C. 15
   D. 9

   Answer: D
   Explanation: The sum is 36, which becomes 6 after the end-around carry. The sender then complements this result (15 - 6) to get the checksum of 9.

Q10. A receiver using the internet checksum method receives a set of data numbers and a checksum. It calculates the one's complement sum of all received items and gets a result of 15 (for 4-bit words). What is the next step, and what does it signify?
   A. The next step is to complement the result; a value of 0 indicates the message is accepted.
   B. The next step is to discard the message, as a non-zero sum indicates an error.
   C. The next step is to send the sum (15) back to the sender as an acknowledgment.
   D. The next step is to accept the message directly, as the sum of 15 is the success code.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The procedure dictates that the receiver sums all data, including the checksum, and if the complemented sum is 0, the data is accepted as valid.

Q11. What is the primary reason that Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is necessary in a connectionless internetwork like the Internet?
   A. To determine the best path for a packet to travel from source to destination.
   B. To translate a destination IP address into the corresponding link-layer address for the next hop.
   C. To ensure that source and destination IP addresses in a packet are not changed by routers.
   D. To translate a link-layer address into its corresponding IP address.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text states that moving a frame through a link requires the link-layer address of the next node, which ARP provides by mapping from the known IP address.

Q12. The code scheme {000, 011, 101, 110} is given as an example of a Linear Block Code. What is its minimum distance ($d_{min}$)?
   A. 1
   B. 3
   C. 2
   D. 0

   Answer: C
   Explanation: For an LBC, the minimum distance is the number of 1s in the non-zero codeword with the fewest 1s. In this set, the non-zero codewords (011, 101, 110) each have two '1's.

Q13. Which statement accurately contrasts the roles of the Data Link Control (DLC) and Media Access Control (MAC) sublayers as described in the text?
   A. DLC handles framing for broadcast links, while MAC handles framing for point-to-point links.
   B. DLC handles issues common to both point-to-point and broadcast links, while MAC addresses issues specific only to broadcast links.
   C. MAC is responsible for error control, while DLC is responsible for flow control.
   D. MAC controls access to the physical layer, while DLC controls access to the network layer.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This directly reflects the definitions provided in the text, where DLC is general-purpose and MAC is specialized for shared media.

Q14. The concept of 'redundancy' is central to error detection. In block coding where a $k$-bit dataword is converted to an $n$-bit codeword, how are the redundant bits quantified?
   A. The redundant bits are represented by $k$.
   B. The redundant bits are represented by the code rate $k/n$.
   C. The number of redundant bits is $r = n - k$.
   D. The redundant bits are represented by $n$.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text defines the codeword length $n$ as the sum of the dataword length $k$ and the redundant bits $r$, so rearranging gives $r = n - k$.

Q15. A Linear Block Code can detect up to $s$ errors if its minimum Hamming distance ($d_{min}$) satisfies a certain condition. What is this condition?
   A. $d_{min} \ge s - 1$
   B. $d_{min} \ge 2s$
   C. $d_{min} \ge s + 1$
   D. $d_{min} = s$

   Answer: C
   Explanation: For a code to guarantee detection of up to $s$ errors, the minimum distance must be at least one greater than the number of errors.
