Q1. According to the provided text, what is the primary reason for twisting the pairs of copper wires in a twisted-pair cable?
   A. To reduce the overall diameter of the cable.
   B. To cancel out the effects of external noise and crosstalk.
   C. To increase the data rate by allowing for higher frequencies.
   D. To make the cable more flexible for installation in tight spaces.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: Twisting ensures that both wires are likely to be affected equally by external interference, allowing the receiver to filter out the noise by taking the difference between the two signals.

   A. Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP) cable
   B. Fiber-optic cable

Q3. In fiber-optic transmission, what happens when a light ray traveling through the core strikes the cladding at an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle?
   A. The light ray is absorbed by the cladding.
   B. The light ray refracts and bends along the interface.
   C. The light ray reflects back into the core.

   A. It has a much lower bandwidth.
   B. It is highly susceptible to electromagnetic interference.
   C. Signal attenuation is significantly higher.

   B. Susceptibility to electromagnetic interference from external sources.
   C. The high cost of manufacturing the glass core.
   D. The need for a light source to be perfectly aligned with the core.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: By varying the density of the core, light rays traveling longer paths speed up, allowing them to arrive at the destination closer to the same time as rays taking shorter paths, thus reducing distortion.

   A. FM radio broadcasting to a city.
   B. Paging systems for alerting personnel.
   C. Unicast communication between cellular towers.

   B. Layer 0
   C. Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
   D. They are not part of the layered model.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text explicitly suggests that because transmission media are below and controlled by the physical layer, they could be considered as belonging to 'layer zero'.

Q11. What is the primary characteristic of infrared waves that makes them suitable for short-range communication like a TV remote, but unsuitable for long-range communication?
   A. They travel slowly through the air.
   B. They require a physical medium like a cable.
   C. They cannot penetrate walls.
   D. They have a very narrow bandwidth.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This property prevents interference between systems in different rooms, which is an advantage for security and local control, but it makes them useless for communicating through obstacles or over long distances.

   A. Multimode step-index
   B. Multimode graded-index
   C. Single-mode
   D. Shielded-core fiber

   Answer: C
   Explanation: Single-mode fiber has a very small core diameter that limits beams to a small range of angles, essentially forcing one primary path. This minimizes distortion and allows for higher bandwidth over longer distances.

Q14. A parabolic dish antenna is used with which type of unguided media to focus signals to a single point?
   A. Radio waves
   B. Infrared waves
   C. Microwaves
   D. VLF waves

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text states that microwaves need unidirectional antennas, and it explicitly describes the parabolic dish as an antenna that funnels waves to a common focus point, which is characteristic of microwave communication.

Q15. Based on the performance graph for UTP cable (Figure 7.6), what is the general relationship between signal frequency and attenuation?
   A. Attenuation decreases as frequency increases.
   B. Attenuation sharply increases as frequency increases, especially above 100 kHz.
   C. Attenuation is constant across all frequencies.
   D. Attenuation is only affected by the wire gauge, not the frequency.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The figure's accompanying text notes that 'with increasing frequency, the attenuation... sharply increases with frequencies above 100 kHz'.

   A. BNC connector
   B. SC connector
   C. ST connector
   D. MT-RJ connector

   Answer: D
   Explanation: The text explicitly identifies the MT-RJ as a fiber-optic connector that is the same size as the common RJ45 network connector.

Q17. Why does the performance graph for coaxial cable (Figure 7.9) imply that repeaters are frequently needed for long-distance communication?
   A. Because the cable has a very narrow bandwidth.
   B. Because the signal weakens rapidly over distance, as shown by high attenuation.
   C. Because the cable is highly prone to reflection at connection points.
   D. Because the signal travels much slower in coaxial cable than in other media.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text notes, 'although coaxial cable has a much higher bandwidth, the signal weakens rapidly and requires the frequent use of repeaters,' which is reflected in the graph's high dB/km values.

Q18. In the electromagnetic spectrum for wireless communication, which band is located between radio waves and light waves?
   A. Infrared
   B. Gamma rays
   C. VHF (Very High Frequency)
   D. X-rays

   A. Lower initial cost for short distances.
   B. Unidirectional propagation.
   C. Greater immunity to tapping.
   D. Requires less specialized installation expertise.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text states that fiber-optic cables are more immune to tapping because they don't create the antenna effects that copper cables do.

Q20. What is the function of the BNC T connector in the context of coaxial cable usage?
   A. To connect the end of the cable to a device like a TV.
   B. To prevent the reflection of the signal at the end of the cable.
   C. To branch out from the main cable for a connection to a computer.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text states that the BNC T connector is 'used in Ethernet networks to branch out to a connection to a computer or other device'.

Q21. Sky propagation is a method where radio waves are reflected by what layer of the atmosphere?
   A. The troposphere
   B. The stratosphere
   C. The ionosphere
   D. The exosphere

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text explicitly states that in sky propagation, 'higher-frequency radio waves radiate upward into the ionosphere... where they are reflected back to earth'.

   A. The number of twists per inch.
   B. The thickness of the wire.
   C. The material of the insulation.

Q25. In the context of light traveling between two substances of different densities, what is the 'critical angle'?
   A. The angle of incidence that causes the light ray to be completely absorbed.
   B. The angle of incidence that results in the light bending along the interface between the substances.
   C. The maximum possible angle of reflection for any given substance.
   D. The angle at which light travels fastest through a substance.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: As shown in Figure 7.10, when the angle of incidence equals the critical angle, the ray refracts and travels parallel to the surface boundary.
