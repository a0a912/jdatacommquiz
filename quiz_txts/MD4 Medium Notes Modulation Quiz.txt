Q1. In digital-to-analog conversion, which modulation technique alters the frequency of the carrier signal to represent digital data while keeping the peak amplitude and phase constant?
   A. Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
   B. Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
   C. Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
   D. Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)

   Answer: B
   Explanation: FSK represents data by varying the carrier signal's frequency, while amplitude and phase remain constant for all signal elements.


Q2. What is the primary process of analog-to-analog conversion, also known as analog modulation?
   A. Representing analog data with a digital signal.
   B. Representing digital data with an analog signal.
   C. Representing analog data with an analog signal.
   D. Converting a bandpass signal into a baseband signal.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The source material explicitly defines analog-to-analog conversion as the representation of analog data by an analog signal.


Q3. According to the source, what is a stated advantage of Phase Shift Keying (PSK) over Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)?
   A. PSK does not require multiple carrier signals, unlike FSK.
   B. PSK can transmit data at a higher frequency.
   C. PSK is less susceptible to noise.
   D. PSK implementation uses a simpler multiplier circuit.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The material explains that noise can change a signal's amplitude more easily than it can change its phase, making PSK more robust.


Q4. In Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), how are the two carriers configured?
   A. They have different frequencies but are in-phase.
   B. They have the same frequency and are $180^{\circ}$ out-of-phase.
   C. They have the same frequency and are $90^{\circ}$ out-of-phase.
   D. They have different amplitudes and different frequencies.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: QAM uses two carriers of the same frequency, one in-phase and the other quadrature (which is $90^{\circ}$ out-of-phase).


Q5. Which analog modulation technique varies the amplitude of the carrier signal based on the amplitude of the modulating signal?
   A. Frequency Modulation (FM)
   B. Phase Modulation (PM)
   C. Amplitude Modulation (AM)
   D. Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The definition of AM is that the carrier signal is modulated so its amplitude varies with the changing amplitudes of the modulating signal.


Q6. In a constellation diagram, what does the X-axis typically represent?
   A. The peak amplitude of the signal element.
   B. The quadrature carrier component.
   C. The in-phase carrier component.
   D. The phase of the signal element.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The diagram has two axes, and the source specifies that the X-axis relates to the in-phase (I) carrier.


Q7. How is Phase Modulation (PM) different from Frequency Modulation (FM), according to the provided text?
   A. In PM, the frequency change is proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal.
   B. In PM, the frequency change is proportional to the derivative of the amplitude of the modulating signal.
   C. PM is implemented with only a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), while FM requires a derivative.
   D. PM keeps the carrier frequency constant, while FM varies it.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text states that in PM, the instantaneous change in carrier frequency is proportional to the derivative of the modulating signal's amplitude.


Q8. Based on the constellation diagram for QPSK shown in Figure 5.13, what is the amplitude of each signal element?
   A. 1 V
   B. $2$ V
   C. $0$ V
   D. $\sqrt{2}$ V

   Answer: D
   Explanation: As explained in the figure's notes, the amplitude is calculated using Pythagoras' Theorem on the 1 V in-phase and 1 V quadrature components.


Q9. Which of these characteristics is NOT one of the three fundamental properties that define a sine wave, as mentioned in the text?
   A. Peak amplitude
   B. Frequency
   C. Wavelength
   D. Phase

   Answer: C
   Explanation: While related to frequency, wavelength is not listed as one of the three fundamental properties used to define the sine wave in this context.


Q10. In the constellation diagram for Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (BASK), why are the two points located on the X-axis?
   A. Because BASK uses both in-phase and quadrature carriers.
   B. Because BASK only uses an in-phase carrier.
   C. Because BASK varies the phase, which is measured along the X-axis.
   D. Because one bit is represented by 0 V amplitude.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source states that since BASK uses only an in-phase carrier (represented by the X-axis), the points lie on that axis.


Q11. Which modulation technique is implemented using a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) to make the carrier frequency change based on the information signal's amplitude?
   A. Amplitude Modulation (AM)
   B. Frequency Modulation (FM)
   C. Phase Modulation (PM)
   D. Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text specifies that FM is normally implemented by using a voltage-controlled oscillator.


Q12. What remains constant during Phase Shift Keying (PSK)?
   A. Only the peak amplitude.
   B. Only the frequency.
   C. The peak amplitude and frequency.
   D. The phase and frequency.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text for PSK explicitly states that 'Both the peak amplitude and frequency remain constant as the phase changes'.


Q13. A constellation diagram for BPSK (Binary PSK) shows two points on the X-axis. One represents binary 1 with an amplitude of 1V. What does the other point represent?
   A. Binary 0 with an amplitude of 0 V.
   B. Binary 0 with an amplitude of 1 V at a $90^{\circ}$ phase shift.
   C. Binary 0 with an amplitude of -1 V (or 1 V at $180^{\circ}$ out of phase).
   D. Binary 0 with an amplitude of $\sqrt{2}$ V.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The provided figure for BPSK shows the two points are on the X-axis, with binary 0 having an amplitude of 1 V but being $180^{\circ}$ out of phase with binary 1.


Q14. What is the role of the 'modulating signal' in Amplitude Modulation (AM)?
   A. It determines the frequency of the modulated carrier.
   B. It becomes the envelope of the carrier wave.
   C. It determines the phase of the modulated carrier.
   D. It is a digital signal used to switch the carrier on or off.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source material states, 'The modulating signal is the envelope of the carrier'.


Q15. Which of the following is NOT one of the four pieces of information that can be deduced from a single point (symbol) on a constellation diagram?
   A. Peak amplitude of the in-phase (I) component.
   B. Frequency of the signal element.
   C. Peak signal amplitude of the signal element.
   D. Phase of the signal element.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: Constellation diagrams show amplitude and phase relationships for a given carrier frequency; they do not show the frequency itself.


Q16. In Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), what remains constant for all signal elements?
   A. Only the frequency.
   B. The peak amplitude and phase.
   C. Only the peak amplitude.
   D. The frequency and phase.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The definition of FSK provided states that 'Both the peak amplitude and phase remain constant for all signal elements'.


Q17. What is the fundamental concept behind Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)?
   A. Altering only the phase of a single carrier signal at multiple levels.
   B. Using multiple carrier signals, each with a different frequency.
   C. Varying both the amplitude and the phase of the signal.
   D. Modulating an analog signal's amplitude to match another analog signal.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The source explicitly asks 'what if we alter two and combine ASK (amplitude) and PSK (phase)?' to introduce the concept of QAM.
