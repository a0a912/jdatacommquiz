Q1. In a datagram network, if two packets from the same message are sent from source A to destination X, what is the most likely reason they might arrive out of order?
   A. The packets are processed by switches based on a priority field in their headers.
   B. Each packet may travel a different path through the network, experiencing different total delays.
   C. The destination system X reassembles packets in the reverse order they are received.
   D. A dedicated circuit is established for each packet, and some circuits are slower than others.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The material states that each packet is treated independently and may travel different paths, leading to varying delays and potential out-of-order arrival.


Q2. What is the primary trade-off between the efficiency of a circuit-switched network and a datagram network, especially for computer-to-computer communication?
   A. Circuit-switched networks have higher efficiency due to minimal delay, whereas datagram networks are less efficient due to variable delays.
   B. Datagram networks achieve higher resource efficiency by allocating resources on demand, at the cost of potentially longer and more variable packet delays.
   C. Circuit-switched networks are more efficient because they do not require complex routing tables, unlike datagram networks.
   D. Datagram networks are less efficient because they require a setup and teardown phase for each message, consuming extra resources.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This correctly identifies that on-demand resource allocation improves efficiency but can lead to queuing delays at switches, which is the core trade-off discussed.


Q3. How does addressing in a virtual-circuit network packet header differ fundamentally from addressing in a datagram network packet header?
   A. Virtual-circuit addresses are end-to-end and remain constant, while datagram addresses change at each switch.
   B. Virtual-circuit packet addresses have local jurisdiction, identifying the next hop, whereas datagram addresses specify the final end-to-end destination.
   C. Both network types use identical end-to-end addressing schemes, but virtual-circuits store them in a switch table instead of the header.
   D. Datagram networks do not use destination addresses in packet headers; they rely solely on the switch's internal routing logic.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source specifies that virtual-circuit addresses only have local jurisdiction, while the destination address in a datagram header remains the same for the entire journey.


Q4. Which of the following scenarios would expose the greatest inefficiency of a circuit-switched network?
   A. A continuous, high-volume video stream between two users.
   B. A computer connected to a remote server for an interactive session with long pauses between user commands.
   C. A telephone conversation where both parties talk constantly.
   D. A network where hundreds of small, independent data packets are sent from many sources to many destinations.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source highlights this exact scenario, where a connection remains active (and resources dedicated) even during long periods of inactivity, making it inefficient.


Q5. A virtual-circuit network is described as a 'cross' between a circuit-switched and a datagram network. Which characteristic does it inherit from circuit-switched networks?
   A. Resources are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis without reservation.
   B. Each packet is treated independently and can follow a different path to the destination.
   C. Communication involves setup and teardown phases, and all packets follow the same established path.
   D. The message is sent as a continuous stream of data over a dedicated physical channel.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The presence of setup/teardown phases and a fixed path for all packets are defining features that virtual-circuit networks share with circuit-switched networks.


Q6. According to the source, at which layers of the network model are circuit-switching, datagram switching, and virtual-circuit switching typically implemented?
   A. Physical layer, Data link layer, and Network layer, respectively.
   B. Network layer, Data link layer, and Physical layer, respectively.
   C. Physical layer, Network layer, and Data link layer, respectively.
   D. Data link layer, Network layer, and Transport layer, respectively.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The source material notes that circuit-switching is at the physical layer, datagram switching is at the network layer, and virtual-circuit switching is normally at the data link layer.


Q7. In the delay calculation for a datagram network, what does the 'Store and Forward' mechanism imply for each switch in the path?
   A. The switch reads only the packet header, stores the destination address, and immediately forwards the rest of the packet.
   B. The switch must receive and buffer the entire packet before it can begin transmitting it to the next hop.
   C. The switch forwards the packet as soon as the destination address is read, reducing latency.
   D. The switch stores a permanent copy of the packet for routing analysis before forwarding the original.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This is the definition of the 'Store and Forward' mechanism, which contributes to the transmission delay at each switch.


Q8. Under what specific condition can the delay for each packet in a virtual-circuit network be different, similar to a datagram network?
   A. When the setup and teardown phases experience high latency.
   B. When resources are allocated on-demand during the data transfer phase.
   C. When the packets are sent through different physical links despite following the same virtual path.
   D. When the network is implemented at the data link layer instead of the network layer.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text explicitly states that if resources are reserved during setup, delay is the same for each packet, but if allocated on-demand, the delay may be different.


Q9. Why is the destination address in a datagram's header said to have 'end-to-end' jurisdiction?
   A. Because the address must be translated by each switch into a local address.
   B. Because the switch uses it to look up a pre-established end-to-end circuit.
   C. Because the address identifies the final destination and remains unchanged throughout the packet's entire journey.
   D. Because it contains the full path of switches the packet must traverse from end to end.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text confirms that this address remains the same during the entire journey, guiding the packet from the source all the way to the final destination.


Q10. What is the key function of a switch in a switched network as defined in the source material?
   A. To create permanent, dedicated connections between any two devices on the network.
   B. To broadcast all incoming data to every device connected to it.
   C. To divide messages into smaller packets of a fixed size for transmission.
   D. To create temporary connections between two or more devices linked to the switch.

   Answer: D
   Explanation: This matches the definition provided in the text, which emphasizes the role of switches in establishing temporary links to enable communication.


Q11. In a circuit-switched network, what is the purpose of the 'connection teardown' phase?
   A. To verify that all data has been successfully transferred and acknowledged.
   B. To send a signal to each switch to release the dedicated resources for other connections.
   C. To update the routing tables in each switch with the information from the completed call.
   D. To reassemble all the data packets into the original message at the destination.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This accurately describes the function of the teardown phase: to free up the channels on each link that were reserved during the setup phase.


Q12. Which statement accurately describes the state of routing tables in a datagram network as presented in the material?
   A. They are static and configured once when the switch is installed.
   B. They are populated during a connection setup phase and cleared during teardown.
   C. They are dynamic and updated periodically to reflect network changes.
   D. They are not used; packets are simply flooded to all output ports except the one they arrived on.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This aligns with the text, which notes that routing tables are updated periodically, allowing for adaptive routing.


Q13. The total delay for a packet in a circuit-switched network during the data transfer phase is minimal. Why is this the case?
   A. Because the packets are very small and can be processed almost instantly by the switches.
   B. Because all resources are allocated in advance, so data is not delayed by waiting at each switch.
   C. Because circuit-switched networks use faster physical links (like fiber optics) than packet-switched networks.
   D. Because the switches do not need to read the address, as the path is physically hardwired.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text states that because resources are dedicated, data is not delayed at each switch, which is the key reason for minimal transfer delay.


Q14. How are the individual communication channels on a single physical link typically created in a circuit-switched network?
   A. By assigning a unique virtual circuit identifier (VCI) to each connection.
   B. By using Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) or Time Division Multiplexing (TDM).
   C. By encapsulating data in frames with different destination MAC addresses.
   D. By using a first-come, first-served (FCFS) queuing system at each switch.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source material explicitly mentions that links are divided into 'n' channels using FDM or TDM.


Q15. What is the primary difference between how a datagram network and a virtual-circuit network handle a multi-packet message?
   A. The datagram network sends the entire message as one large datagram, while the virtual-circuit network divides it into packets.
   B. The datagram network requires a connection setup, while the virtual-circuit network is connectionless.
   C. The datagram network may route each packet differently, while the virtual-circuit network sends all packets along the same pre-established path.
   D. The datagram network has minimal delay, while the virtual-circuit network has significant waiting time at each switch.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This correctly identifies the key difference: independent routing per-packet in datagram networks versus a fixed path for all packets in a virtual-circuit network.


Q16. A network is described as 'connectionless'. Based on the source material, what does this imply about the switches within that network?
   A. The switches are not physically connected to each other.
   B. The switches do not retain any information about connection states.
   C. The switches must establish a dedicated path before any data can be transferred.
   D. The switches forward packets based on local virtual circuit identifiers instead of destination addresses.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text explicitly defines 'connectionless' in this context, stating that the switch does not keep information about the connection state.


Q17. What is the role of 'end-to-end addressing' during the connection setup phase of a circuit-switched network?
   A. It is used by each switch to dynamically update its routing table for the new connection.
   B. It is included in the header of every data unit to ensure it reaches the correct destination.
   C. It is required to identify the two end systems so that a dedicated circuit can be established between them.
   D. It allows the network to divide the message into packets and number them sequentially.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text notes that end-to-end addressing (e.g., telephone numbers) is required for creating the connection between the two systems during the setup phase.


Q18. The total delay calculation for a virtual-circuit network includes setup time and teardown time, which are absent from the per-packet delay calculation for a datagram network. Why?
   A. Because virtual-circuit networks are much slower, requiring these extra time components to be factored in.
   B. Because datagram networks are connectionless and do not have connection setup or teardown phases.
   C. Because setup and teardown times in datagram networks are so small they are considered negligible.
   D. Because the delay formula for datagrams only considers a single switch, while the virtual-circuit formula considers the entire path.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This is the core reason. Since datagram networks do not establish a connection beforehand, there are no setup or teardown delays to consider.


Q19. In the example of connecting two remote offices with a T1 line, what was the stated purpose of folding back four output ports on each 4x8 switch to become input ports?
   A. To double the bandwidth available for communication between the two offices.
   B. To provide a redundant backup path in case the T1 line between offices fails.
   C. To allow computers within the same office to communicate with each other through the switch.
   D. To connect the switch to a local router for internet access.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text explicitly states this configuration allows for communication between computers in the same office, effectively using the switch for both local and remote traffic.


Q20. Which of these three switching methods is characterized by having no resource reservation whatsoever?
   A. Circuit switching
   B. Packet switching (datagram approach)
   C. Packet switching (virtual-circuit approach)
   D. Message switching

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text explicitly states that in packet switching, there is no resource reservation, and the datagram approach exemplifies this by allocating resources on-demand.


Q21. The delay formula for a datagram network is given as a sum of transmission, propagation, and waiting times. What does propagation time represent?
   A. The time it takes for a switch to process the packet header and consult its routing table.
   B. The time it takes to push all of the packet's bits onto the link.
   C. The time a packet spends in a queue at a switch waiting for its turn to be transmitted.
   D. The time it takes for a bit to travel from one end of a physical link to the other.

   Answer: D
   Explanation: This is the correct definition of propagation time, which is determined by the distance and the speed of the signal in the medium.


Q22. Which statement best explains why packet switching is divided into datagram and virtual-circuit subcategories?
   A. Because some packet networks are for voice (virtual-circuit) and others are for data (datagram).
   B. Because they represent a trade-off between the flexibility of connectionless routing and the predictability of a connection-oriented path.
   C. Because the datagram approach is an older, obsolete technology, and the virtual-circuit approach is the modern replacement.
   D. Because datagrams are used for small messages and virtual-circuits are required for large messages.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This captures the essence of the division: the datagram approach offers flexibility with independent routing, while the virtual-circuit approach offers predictability with a fixed path, blending packet switching with connection-oriented concepts.


Q23. In a datagram network, what is the direct consequence of a switch treating each packet 'as though it existed alone'?
   A. The network can guarantee that all packets will be delivered within a specific time frame.
   B. The network can provide a highly efficient use of resources because no state is maintained for connections.
   C. All packets belonging to the same message must follow the exact same path through the network.
   D. A connection setup phase is required to inform the switches that a new, independent packet stream is starting.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: By not maintaining connection state, switches are simplified and resources are used purely on demand, which is a major efficiency benefit described in the text.


Q24. What is the key difference in resource allocation between a virtual-circuit network that reserves resources at setup versus one that allocates them on-demand?
   A. On-demand allocation is more efficient but results in uniform packet delay, while reservation at setup is less efficient but has variable delay.
   B. Reservation at setup guarantees a certain quality of service with uniform delay, while on-demand allocation shares resources and can lead to variable delays.
   C. Reservation at setup is only possible at the Network Layer, while on-demand allocation is only possible at the Data Link Layer.
   D. There is no functional difference; both methods ultimately result in all packets following the same path with the same total delay.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This correctly summarizes the trade-off: reservation acts like a circuit, guaranteeing resources and predictable delay, while on-demand acts like a datagram network, sharing resources efficiently at the cost of potential queuing delays.


Q25. A switched network is defined as a series of 'interlinked nodes called switches'. What problem does this architecture solve?
   A. The problem of dividing large messages into smaller packets.
   B. The problem of how to connect multiple devices to enable one-to-one communication.
   C. The problem of converting analog signals to digital signals for transmission.
   D. The problem of assigning unique end-to-end addresses to every device in a network.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text introduces switching as the solution to exactly this problem: managing connections between multiple devices.
