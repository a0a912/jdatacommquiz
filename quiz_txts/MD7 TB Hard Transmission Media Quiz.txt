Q1. In a fiber-optic cable, what is the direct consequence of a light ray striking the core-cladding interface at an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle?
   A. The light ray is absorbed by the cladding material.
   B. The light ray is refracted and bends along the interface.
   C. The light ray is reflected back into the core.
   D. The light ray passes through the cladding and escapes the cable.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This phenomenon, known as total internal reflection, is the fundamental principle that traps light within the core, allowing it to propagate over long distances.

Q2. Which of the following best explains why multimode graded-index fiber reduces signal distortion compared to multimode step-index fiber?
   A. It uses a much smaller core diameter to limit the number of light paths.
   B. The constant density of the core ensures all light beams travel at the same speed.
   C. Its core has a varying density that is highest at the center, causing light beams to travel in curved paths of similar travel time.
   D. It uses a special cladding that reflects light more efficiently than step-index fiber.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The gradual decrease in density from the core's center to its edge causes light to speed up in the outer regions, effectively equalizing the travel time for different paths and reducing distortion.
