Q1. A signal's power is reduced to one-fourth of its original strength as it passes through a medium. What is the attenuation in decibels (dB)?
   A. $-6$ dB
   B. $-3$ dB
   C. $-4$ dB
   D. $4$ dB

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Attenuation is calculated as $10 \log_{10}(P_2/P_1)$. Since $P_2 = 0.25 P_1$, this becomes $10 \log_{10}(0.25) \approx 10(-0.6) = -6$ dB.

Q2. What correctly describes the frequency domain representation of a periodic composite signal?
   A. It consists of a series of discrete spikes at specific frequencies.
   B. It is a continuous curve representing an infinite number of frequencies.
   C. It is represented by a single spike at its fundamental frequency.
   D. It shows a flat line, indicating zero frequency components.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: A periodic signal, being a repeating pattern, can be decomposed into a fundamental frequency and its integer multiples (harmonics), which appear as discrete frequencies in the frequency domain.

Q3. A noiseless channel has a bandwidth of 20 kHz. How many signal levels are needed to transmit data at a rate of 240 kbps?
   A. 4 levels
   B. 8 levels
   C. 32 levels
   D. 64 levels

   Answer: D
   Explanation: Using the Nyquist formula, $240,000 = 2 \times 20,000 \times \log_2(L)$. This simplifies to $6 = \log_2(L)$, so $L = 2^6 = 64$.

Q4. What is the primary characteristic of baseband transmission?
   A. The digital signal is sent directly over a low-pass channel without modulation.
   B. The digital signal is converted to an analog signal using a carrier frequency.
   C. It is only suitable for wireless communication over long distances.
   D. It combines multiple signals into different frequency bands.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Baseband transmission involves sending the digital signal in its original form, which requires a channel with a bandwidth that starts from zero (a low-pass channel).

Q5. If a sine wave completes one full cycle in 25 microseconds (µs), what is its frequency?
   A. 40 kHz
   B. 25 MHz
   C. 400 Hz
   D. 0.04 Hz

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Frequency is the inverse of the period ($f = 1/T$). First, convert the period to seconds: $25 \mu s = 25 \times 10^{-6}$ s. Then, $f = 1 / (25 \times 10^{-6}) = 40,000$ Hz, or 40 kHz.

Q6. A network link has a bandwidth of 10 Mbps. It takes 40 ms for a bit to travel from the sender to the receiver. What is the bandwidth-delay product of this link?
   A. 400,000 bits
   B. 400 bits
   C. 250,000 bits
   D. 1,000,000 bits

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The product is calculated by multiplying bandwidth by delay. Bandwidth = $10 \times 10^6$ bps. Delay = $40 \times 10^{-3}$ s. The product is $(10 \times 10^6) \times (40 \times 10^{-3}) = 400,000$ bits.

Q7. Which of the following scenarios is primarily limited by the Shannon Capacity formula?
   A. Determining the maximum data rate of a telephone line with a known signal-to-noise ratio.
   B. Calculating the number of signal levels needed for a specific bit rate on a perfectly clean, noiseless fiber optic cable.
   C. Measuring the actual data transfer speed of a file download, which is affected by network congestion.
   D. Finding the time it takes for a signal to travel across a satellite link.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The Shannon capacity formula specifically calculates the theoretical maximum data rate for a noisy channel, making it the appropriate tool for this scenario.

Q8. A digital signal uses 8 distinct voltage levels to represent data. How many bits are sent per level?
   A. 3 bits
   B. 8 bits
   C. 4 bits
   D. 2 bits

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The number of bits per level is calculated as $\log_2(L)$, where L is the number of levels. In this case, $\log_2(8) = 3$.

Q9. A composite signal is made of components with frequencies ranging from 1.2 MHz to 1.8 MHz. What is the bandwidth of this signal?
   A. 600 kHz
   B. 3.0 MHz
   C. 1.8 MHz
   D. 1.5 MHz

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Bandwidth is the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies in a signal. $1.8$ MHz $- 1.2$ MHz $= 0.6$ MHz, which is equal to 600 kHz.

Q10. In the context of network performance, how does 'throughput' differ from 'bandwidth'?
   A. Bandwidth is the theoretical maximum data rate, while throughput is the actual measured data rate.
   B. Bandwidth is measured in Hertz (Hz), while throughput is measured in bits per second (bps).
   C. Throughput is always higher than bandwidth due to data compression.
   D. They are identical terms for the speed of a network link.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Bandwidth represents the potential capacity of a link, whereas throughput is the actual rate at which data is successfully transmitted, which can be lower due to factors like congestion and device limitations.

Q11. A sine wave is described as having a phase of 90 degrees. What does this mean about its starting position at time t=0?
   A. It starts at its peak amplitude.
   B. It starts at zero amplitude and is increasing.
   C. It starts at its minimum (negative peak) amplitude.
   D. It starts at zero amplitude and is decreasing.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: A 90-degree phase shift corresponds to a shift of one-quarter of a cycle to the left, causing the wave to start at its maximum positive value at time zero.

Q12. A 5 MB image file is transmitted over a 4 Mbps network link. What is the transmission time?
   A. 10 seconds
   B. 1.25 seconds
   C. 80 seconds
   D. 1 second

   Answer: A
   Explanation: First, convert the file size to bits: $5 \text{ MB} = 5 \times 10^6 \text{ bytes} \times 8 \text{ bits/byte} = 40 \times 10^6$ bits. Then, divide by the bandwidth: $(40 \times 10^6 \text{ bits}) / (4 \times 10^6 \text{ bps}) = 10$ seconds.

Q13. Which type of transmission impairment is caused by the varying propagation speeds of different frequency components within a composite signal?
   A. Distortion
   B. Attenuation
   C. Noise
   D. Jitter

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Distortion occurs when a signal's shape changes because its various frequency components travel at slightly different speeds, causing them to arrive out of phase at the destination.

Q14. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a channel is given as 30 dB. What is the corresponding numerical SNR value?
   A. 100
   B. 1000
   C. 300
   D. 30

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The formula is $\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}} = 10 \log_{10}(\text{SNR})$. To find SNR, we calculate $10^{(\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}/10)}$. So, SNR $= 10^{(30/10)} = 10^3 = 1000$.

Q15. What is the primary reason for using broadband transmission (modulation) to send computer data over a telephone line?
   A. The telephone line is a bandpass channel and cannot transmit the baseband digital signal directly.
   B. To increase the physical propagation speed of the signal in the wire.
   C. To convert the signal from analog to digital at the source.
   D. To eliminate all noise from the telephone line.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Telephone lines are designed for voice and have a limited bandwidth that does not start at 0 Hz (it's a bandpass channel). Modulation is required to shift the digital signal's frequencies into the range the channel can pass.

Q16. A signal travels through a cable with a loss of -0.5 dB/km. If the signal starts with a power of 10 mW, what is its approximate power after traveling 6 km?
   A. 10 mW
   B. 5 mW
   C. 7 mW
   D. 2.5 mW

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The total loss is $6 \text{ km} \times -0.5 \text{ dB/km} = -3$ dB. A loss of 3 dB corresponds to a halving of the signal power, so the final power is $10 \text{ mW} / 2 = 5$ mW.

Q17. According to Fourier analysis, what is the fundamental characteristic of a digital signal?
   A. It has a single, discrete frequency.
   B. It is a composite analog signal with an infinite bandwidth.
   C. It is a signal that cannot be represented in the frequency domain.
   D. It only contains high-frequency components.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The sharp vertical and horizontal lines of a digital signal require components from zero frequency (for flat parts) to infinite frequency (for instantaneous changes), making it a composite signal with infinite bandwidth.

Q18. What is the propagation time for a signal to travel over a 6,000 km cable link if the propagation speed in the cable is $2 \times 10^8$ m/s?
   A. 30 ms
   B. 3 ms
   C. 300 ms
   D. 20 ms

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Propagation time = Distance / Speed. The distance is $6,000 \text{ km} = 6 \times 10^6$ m. So, time = $(6 \times 10^6 \text{ m}) / (2 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) = 0.03$ s, which is 30 ms.

Q19. A sine wave has a frequency of 50 Hz. What is its period?
   A. 20 ms
   B. 50 s
   C. 0.05 s
   D. 2 ms

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Period is the inverse of frequency ($T = 1/f$). $T = 1 / 50 \text{ Hz} = 0.02$ seconds. Converting to milliseconds gives $0.02 \times 1000 = 20$ ms.

Q20. Which of the following defines 'jitter' in the context of network performance?
   A. The variation in delay for packets arriving at the destination.
   B. The total time it takes for a message to travel from source to destination.
   C. The loss of signal strength over a distance.
   D. The number of bits that can fill a network link at any given time.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Jitter is the unevenness in packet arrival times, which is problematic for real-time applications like video and audio streaming.

Q21. A telephone line has a bandwidth of 3000 Hz and a signal-to-noise ratio of 3162. What is its theoretical maximum data rate according to Shannon?
   A. Approximately 34.8 kbps
   B. Approximately 6000 bps
   C. Approximately 9.5 Mbps
   D. Approximately 3.1 kbps

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Using Shannon's formula: $C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}) = 3000 \times \log_2(1 + 3162) = 3000 \times \log_2(3163) \approx 3000 \times 11.62 \approx 34,860$ bps.

Q22. What is the wavelength of an electromagnetic signal with a frequency of 100 MHz in a vacuum, where the propagation speed is $3 \times 10^8$ m/s?
   A. 3 meters
   B. 30 meters
   C. 0.3 meters
   D. 300 meters

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Wavelength ($\lambda$) is calculated as propagation speed (c) divided by frequency (f). $\lambda = c/f = (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) / (100 \times 10^6 \text{ Hz}) = 3$ meters.

Q23. If we want to approximate a digital signal using baseband transmission over a channel with limited bandwidth, what does using more harmonics (e.g., first, third, and fifth) achieve?
   A. The resulting analog signal more closely resembles the original digital signal.
   B. It decreases the required bandwidth for transmission.
   C. It converts the transmission from baseband to broadband.
   D. It completely eliminates transmission impairment.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Adding more harmonics (higher frequency components) allows the analog signal to better replicate the sharp corners and flat lines of the digital signal, leading to a more accurate representation.

Q24. Which of the following is an example of digital data?
   A. Text stored in a computer file as a series of 0s and 1s.
   B. The sound of a human voice captured by a microphone.
   C. The changing position of the second hand on an analog clock.
   D. A live broadcast signal from an FM radio station.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Digital data refers to information that has discrete states. Data stored in computer memory in binary form is a primary example of this.

Q25. Two signals have the same frequency and phase. What characteristic must be different if one signal has a higher peak amplitude than the other?
   A. The energy the signal carries.
   B. The period of the signal.
   C. The wavelength of the signal.
   D. The rate of change of the signal.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The peak amplitude of a signal is proportional to the energy it carries. A higher amplitude means more energy.
