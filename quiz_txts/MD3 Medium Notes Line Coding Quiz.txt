Q1. Which line coding category is characterized by using three distinct voltage levels: positive, negative, and zero?
   A. Bipolar
   B. Unipolar
   C. Polar
   D. Return-to-Zero (RZ)

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Bipolar schemes, such as AMI and Pseudoternary, utilize positive, negative, and zero voltage levels to represent binary data.


Q2. In the context of polar schemes, what distinguishes NRZ-Invert (NRZ-I) from NRZ-Level (NRZ-L)?
   A. NRZ-I uses a change or lack of change in voltage to represent a bit, while NRZ-L uses the voltage level itself.
   B. NRZ-L uses three voltage levels, while NRZ-I uses only two.
   C. NRZ-I is self-synchronizing, while NRZ-L is not.
   D. NRZ-L represents bit '1' with a positive voltage, while NRZ-I represents bit '1' with a negative voltage.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This correctly identifies the core difference: NRZ-I is based on voltage transitions, whereas NRZ-L is based on the static voltage level during the bit period.


Q3. A data transmission system operates at 5 Mbps. If the receiver's clock runs 0.5% faster than the sender's clock, how many extra bits per second does the receiver attempt to read?
   A. 25,000 bps
   B. 5,000 bps
   C. 5,025,000 bps
   D. 2,500 bps

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This is calculated as 0.5% of 5,000,000 bps ($5,000,000 \times 0.005 = 25,000$).


Q4. What is the primary advantage of using a Return-to-Zero (RZ) scheme over a Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) scheme?
   A. It includes timing information within the signal.
   B. It requires less bandwidth.
   C. It is simpler to implement.
   D. It uses only positive voltages.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: RZ schemes are self-synchronizing because the signal changes during each bit, which helps the receiver maintain clock synchronization.


Q5. According to the Nyquist theorem, what is the minimum sampling rate required to accurately digitize a low-pass signal with a bandwidth of 75 kHz?
   A. 150,000 samples/sec
   B. 75,000 samples/sec
   C. 37,500 samples/sec
   D. 300,000 samples/sec

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The minimum sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum frequency ($f_{max}$), which is 75 kHz for this low-pass signal ($2 \times 75,000 = 150,000$).


Q6. What is the consequence of sampling an analog signal at a rate less than the Nyquist rate?
   A. Aliasing
   B. Quantization error
   C. Increased bit rate
   D. Signal redundancy

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Undersampling (sampling below the Nyquist rate) causes aliasing, where the reconstructed signal has incorrect, lower-frequency components.


Q7. A PCM system needs to achieve a quantizing signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR_Q$) of at least 35 dB. What is the minimum number of bits per sample ($n_b$) required?
   A. 6 bits
   B. 5 bits
   C. 7 bits
   D. 4 bits

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Using the formula $35 \le 6.02n_b + 1.76$, solving for $n_b$ gives $n_b \ge 5.52$. Since bits must be an integer, the minimum is 6 bits.


Q8. In the Pseudoternary line coding scheme, which bit is represented by a zero voltage level?
   A. Bit 1
   B. Bit 0
   C. Both bit 0 and bit 1
   D. Neither bit 0 nor bit 1

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Pseudoternary is a variation of AMI where bit 1 is represented by zero voltage, and bit 0 alternates between positive and negative voltages.


Q9. We want to digitize an audio signal with a maximum frequency of 20 kHz. If each sample is quantized into 1024 levels, what is the resulting bit rate?
   A. 400,000 bps
   B. 200,000 bps
   C. 40,000 bps
   D. 800,000 bps

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The sampling rate is $2 \times 20 \text{ kHz} = 40,000$ samples/sec. The number of bits per sample is $\log_2(1024) = 10$. The bit rate is $40,000 \times 10 = 400,000$ bps.


Q10. Why is it impossible to determine the minimum sampling rate for a band-pass signal given only its bandwidth of 200 kHz?
   A. The maximum frequency ($f_{max}$) of the signal is unknown.
   B. The Nyquist theorem only applies to low-pass signals.
   C. The bandwidth is too high for sampling.
   D. The signal-to-noise ratio is not provided.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The Nyquist theorem for low-pass signals relies on the absolute maximum frequency, which cannot be determined from the bandwidth of a band-pass signal alone (e.g., a 200 kHz bandwidth could be from 100-300 kHz or 1000-1200 kHz).


Q11. Which line coding scheme combines the concepts of Return-to-Zero (RZ) and NRZ-Level (NRZ-L) by having a mandatory transition in the middle of each bit period?
   A. Manchester
   B. Differential Manchester
   C. Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI)
   D. Unipolar NRZ

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Manchester encoding is defined by a mid-bit transition which serves for both clocking and data representation, combining the level-based aspect of NRZ-L with the timing of RZ.


Q12. In the Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) process, what is the purpose of the 'quantization' step?
   A. To assign a discrete numerical value to each sampled amplitude.
   B. To convert the analog signal into a series of discrete time samples.
   C. To convert the discrete numerical values into a binary bit stream.
   D. To remove high-frequency noise from the signal before conversion.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Quantization takes the continuous range of sampled amplitudes and maps each one to a value from a finite set of discrete levels.


Q13. The process of converting a sequence of bits into a digital signal for transmission is known as:
   A. Line coding
   B. Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
   C. Quantization
   D. Sampling

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The source material explicitly defines line coding as the process of converting digital data (a sequence of bits) to digital signals.


Q14. If a PCM system uses 6 bits per sample, how many distinct quantization levels can it represent?
   A. 64
   B. 32
   C. 128
   D. 12

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The number of levels (L) is related to the number of bits per sample ($n_b$) by the formula $L = 2^{n_b}$. Therefore, $L = 2^6 = 64$.


Q15. What characteristic defines a Unipolar line coding scheme?
   A. All voltage levels are on one side of the time axis.
   B. Voltage levels alternate between positive and negative for each bit.
   C. A transition occurs in the middle of every bit.
   D. Three distinct voltage levels are used.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: In a unipolar scheme, the voltages used are either all positive or all negative, plus a zero level.


Q16. Which of the following is NOT a category of line coding schemes mentioned in the source material?
   A. Multiplex
   B. Unipolar
   C. Polar
   D. Bipolar

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Multiplexing is a technique for combining multiple signals for transmission over a shared medium; it is not a category of line coding.


Q17. In Differential Manchester encoding, what determines the representation of the next bit?
   A. The presence or absence of a transition at the beginning of the bit interval.
   B. The direction of the transition in the middle of the bit interval.
   C. The voltage level (positive or negative) during the first half of the bit.
   D. The return to a zero voltage level in the middle of the bit.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This scheme combines RZ and NRZ-I; a transition at the start of the bit signals a 0, while no transition signals a 1. The mid-bit transition is for clocking only.


Q18. A signal is sampled 8,000 times per second, and each sample is represented by a 10-bit code word. What is the bit rate of the resulting digital signal?
   A. 80,000 bps
   B. 8,000 bps
   C. 10,000 bps
   D. 800 bps

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The bit rate is the product of the sampling rate ($f_s$) and the number of bits per sample ($n_b$), so $8,000 \times 10 = 80,000$ bps.


Q19. Oversampling a signal (sampling at a rate greater than $2 \times f_{max}$) is described as:
   A. Redundant and unnecessary, but creates a good approximation.
   B. The cause of aliasing and information loss.
   C. The most efficient method for analog-to-digital conversion.
   D. Impossible to perform with modern equipment.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The text states that oversampling can create the same approximation as sampling at the Nyquist rate but is redundant and unnecessary.


Q20. What is the primary source of 'quantization error' in the PCM process?
   A. The approximation of an infinite number of analog amplitude values to a finite set of discrete levels.
   B. The mismatch between the sender and receiver clocks during transmission.
   C. Sampling the analog signal at a rate lower than the Nyquist rate.
   D. The conversion of the binary code words into a digital signal using line coding.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Quantization is an approximation process, and the difference between the actual analog amplitude and the chosen discrete level is the quantization error.


Q21. The Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) name indicates that the signal:
   A. Does not return to zero in the middle of a bit period.
   B. Never uses the zero voltage level.
   C. Is not suitable for digital transmission.
   D. Alternates polarity for every bit.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Unlike RZ (Return-to-Zero) schemes, the signal level in NRZ remains constant throughout the duration of a bit.


Q22. What does the formula `Bit rate` = $f_s \times n_b$ calculate?
   A. The total number of bits transmitted per second after an analog signal is digitized.
   B. The minimum required sampling rate for a signal.
   C. The signal-to-noise ratio due to quantization.
   D. The number of quantization levels in a PCM system.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This formula correctly multiplies the sampling rate ($f_s$, samples per second) by the number of bits per sample ($n_b$) to find the total bit rate.


Q23. In Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI), how is the bit sequence `01101` represented?
   A. Zero, Positive Voltage, Negative Voltage, Zero, Positive Voltage
   B. Zero, Positive Voltage, Positive Voltage, Zero, Positive Voltage
   C. Positive Voltage, Zero, Zero, Positive Voltage, Zero
   D. Alternating Positive/Negative Voltage, Zero, Alternating Voltage, Zero, Alternating Voltage

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Bit '0' is represented by zero voltage. Bit '1' (a 'mark') is represented by alternating polarity, starting with positive, then negative, then positive again.


Q24. The three processes of a Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) encoder are performed in which order?
   A. Sampling, Quantizing, Encoding
   B. Encoding, Quantizing, Sampling
   C. Quantizing, Sampling, Encoding
   D. Sampling, Encoding, Quantizing

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The source material explicitly lists these three steps in this sequence for the PCM encoding process.


Q25. What is the calculated quantizing signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR_Q$) for a system that uses 8 bits per sample?
   A. Approximately 49.92 dB
   B. Approximately 43.90 dB
   C. 64 dB
   D. 8 dB

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Using the formula $SNR_Q = 6.02n_b + 1.76$, we get $SNR_Q = (6.02 \times 8) + 1.76 = 48.16 + 1.76 = 49.92$ dB.
