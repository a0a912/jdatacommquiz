   B. It uses its forwarding table to find R2's link-layer address directly.
   C. It uses its forwarding table to find R2's IP address (N3), then uses ARP to find the corresponding link-layer address (L3).

Q15. The text explains that a router connected to 'n' links has 'n' IP addresses. What is the reason for this?
   A. To allow the router to change the source IP address of packets it forwards.
   B. Each IP address serves as a backup in case another one fails.
   C. An IP address defines a device's connection point to a specific link, and a router connects to multiple links.
   D. Each IP address is used to communicate with a different transport-layer protocol.

Q16. Within the TCP/IP protocol suite, where does the ARP protocol reside?
