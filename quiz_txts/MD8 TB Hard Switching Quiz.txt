Q1. In a three-stage space-division switch with $N=120$ inputs, designed using the Clos criteria for non-blocking operation, the input lines are divided into groups of $n=10$. What is the minimum number of middle-stage switches ($k$) required?
   A. 10
   B. 20
   C. 19
   D. 12

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This value is derived from the Clos criteria formula $k \ge 2n - 1$, which ensures there is always a path available for a connection.

Q2. What is the total number of crosspoints required for a three-stage $200 \times 200$ switch where $N=200$, the number of middle-stage crossbars is $k=5$, and each of the first-stage groups has $n=20$ lines?
   A. 40,000
   B. 2,500
   C. 4,500
   D. 2,000

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This result is achieved by correctly applying the formula for total crosspoints in a three-stage switch, which is $2Nk + k(N/n)^2$.

Q3. Which of the following best describes the fundamental reason why datagram networks are considered 'connectionless'?
   A. Packets do not require a destination address in their header.
   B. The switches (routers) do not maintain any information about a connection state.
   C. No setup or teardown phases are used, so connections are instantaneous.
   D. All packets belonging to a single message must follow the same path.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The term 'connectionless' refers to the fact that each packet is handled independently without the switches needing to remember a pre-established path or connection.

Q4. In the setup phase of a virtual-circuit network, how does a switch determine the 'outgoing VCI' value for its switching table entry?
   A. It is assigned by the source system in the initial setup request frame.
   B. The switch generates a random VCI and sends it to the next switch.
   C. It is received in an acknowledgment frame from the subsequent switch or destination.
   D. It is calculated based on the global destination address.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The outgoing VCI for one switch is the incoming VCI chosen by the next switch in the path, and this information is passed backward via an acknowledgment.

Q5. What is the primary function of the 'Time-Slot Interchange' (TSI) component in a time-division switch?
   A. To combine multiple input signals into a single stream using crosspoints.
   B. To physically connect an input line to an output line for the duration of a call.
   C. To filter packets based on their destination address.
   D. To change the order of time slots within a TDM frame.

   Answer: D
   Explanation: The TSI uses RAM to store incoming time slots and then sends them out in a different, controlled order to route the data to the correct output line.

Q6. A key advantage of a multistage switch over a single crossbar switch is the reduced number of crosspoints. What is a primary disadvantage introduced by this design?
   A. Increased propagation delay due to more physical components.
   B. Blocking, where a connection cannot be made because no path is available.
   C. Inability to handle digital signals.
   D. The requirement for end-to-end addressing during data transfer.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: By sharing middle-stage crosspoints, it's possible for all available paths between an input and an output to be occupied, even if the output itself is free.

Q7. In a Banyan switch, how is a packet's route determined at each stage of the switch?
   A. By the packet's source address.
   B. By a sequentially corresponding bit of the output port's binary address.
   C. By the input port number where the packet arrived.
   D. By a value looked up in a central routing table.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: Each stage uses one bit from the destination address to make its routing choice; the first stage uses the first bit, the second stage uses the second bit, and so on.

Q8. Which component of a packet switch is responsible for decapsulating a packet from a frame and performing error detection?
   A. The switching fabric
   B. The routing processor
   C. The output port
   D. The input port

   Answer: D
   Explanation: An input port handles the physical and data-link layer functions upon packet arrival, which includes frame processing.

Q9. What is the primary role of the Batcher switch when used in a Batcher-banyan switch configuration?
   A. To route packets based on the bits of their destination address.
   B. To queue packets if their intended output port is busy.
   C. To sort incoming packets based on their destination port.
   D. To convert packets from one protocol to another.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The Batcher switch pre-sorts the packets, which helps to resolve potential internal collisions within the subsequent Banyan switch.

Q10. According to the source material, switching at the data-link layer is typically implemented using which approach?
   A. Circuit switching
   B. Datagram packet switching
   C. Virtual-circuit packet switching
   D. Message switching

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The textbook specifies that packet switching at the data-link layer is normally done using a virtual-circuit approach, as seen in switched WANs.

Q11. Why does a circuit-switched network experience minimal delay during the data transfer phase compared to a packet-switched network?
   A. Because the packets are smaller and can be processed faster.
   B. Because resources like channels and switch processing time are dedicated.
   C. Because it operates at a higher layer of the TCP/IP model.
   D. Because it uses global addressing for every piece of data.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The pre-allocation of a dedicated path during the setup phase means data flows without waiting or queuing at intermediate switches.

Q12. What is a significant difference in how addresses are used in datagram networks versus virtual-circuit networks during data transfer?
   A. Datagrams use no address, while virtual-circuits use a VCI.
   B. Datagrams use a global, end-to-end address, while virtual-circuits use a local VCI.
   C. Both use a global, end-to-end address that remains unchanged.
   D. Datagrams use a local address, while virtual-circuits use a global address.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This correctly identifies that a datagram's destination address remains constant, whereas a VCI changes from switch to switch.

Q13. A Time-Space-Time (TST) switch is designed to combine the advantages of both space-division and time-division switching. What is the main purpose of the central space-division switch in a TST architecture?
   A. To store the time slots in RAM before they are reordered.
   B. To connect the outputs of the first-stage TSIs to the inputs of the third-stage TSIs.
   C. To eliminate the need for setup and teardown phases.
   D. To reduce the total number of crosspoints to zero.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This allows data from any input group (handled by one TSI) to be routed to any output group (handled by another TSI), providing full connectivity.

Q14. In a datagram network, what does a switch's routing table use as the primary key to look up the correct output port for an incoming packet?
   A. The source address of the packet.
   B. A combination of the input port and a virtual circuit identifier.
   C. The destination address of the packet.
   D. The sequence number of the packet within its message.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: Each router in a datagram network makes an independent decision for each packet based solely on its final destination address.

Q15. If a non-blocking three-stage switch is designed according to the Clos criteria, what is the relationship between the number of crosspoints and the number of inputs ($N$)?
   A. The number of crosspoints is proportional to $N^2$.
   B. The number of crosspoints is proportional to $N \log_2 N$.
   C. The number of crosspoints is proportional to $N^{3/2}$.
   D. The number of crosspoints is proportional to $N$.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text explicitly states that for a switch optimized with the Clos criteria, the minimum number of crosspoints is proportional to $N^{3/2}$.

Q16. Which of these communication scenarios is LEAST efficient over a circuit-switched network?
   A. A live, high-definition video conference between two sites.
   B. A traditional telephone call between two people.
   C. A user browsing a series of web pages, with pauses for reading.
   D. A large file transfer operating at the maximum line speed.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This activity is 'bursty,' with long periods of inactivity where the dedicated resources would be idle and wasted.

Q17. What is the consequence of resource allocation being 'on demand' in a packet-switched network?
   A. All packets are guaranteed to arrive with a uniform, minimal delay.
   B. The network can achieve higher overall efficiency by sharing resources.
   C. A setup phase is required to request resources before data transfer.
   D. Packets can never be lost or dropped due to lack of resources.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: Resources that are idle for one connection can be immediately used by another, leading to better utilization of network capacity.

Q18. In a virtual-circuit network, all packets for a given source-destination pair follow the same path. However, the text notes they may still arrive with different delays. Under what condition does this occur?
   A. This can only happen if there is a routing error in one of the switches.
   B. When the packets are of variable size.
   C. When resource allocation is on demand.
   D. This is not possible; all packets on the same path have the same delay.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: If resources are not reserved during setup, each packet must compete for link bandwidth and switch processing time, leading to variable waiting times.

Q19. How many stages and how many microswitches per stage are there in a Banyan switch designed for 64 inputs and 64 outputs?
   A. 6 stages, with 32 microswitches per stage.
   B. 8 stages, with 8 microswitches per stage.
   C. 6 stages, with 64 microswitches per stage.
   D. 64 stages, with 6 microswitches per stage.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This correctly identifies the number of stages as $\log_2(64) = 6$ and the number of microswitches per stage as $64/2 = 32$.

Q20. Which of the three main switching methods has been largely 'phased out in general communications' but still has conceptual networking applications like email?
   A. Circuit switching
   B. Packet switching
   C. Message switching
   D. Datagram switching

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text identifies message switching as the method that has been phased out but is conceptually similar to store-and-forward systems like email.

Q21. The total delay calculation for a packet in a datagram network includes waiting times ($w_1, w_2$, etc.) at each switch. Why are these waiting times absent from the data transfer delay calculation in a circuit-switched network?
   A. Circuit switches are inherently faster than packet switches.
   B. The entire delay is accounted for in the setup phase.
   C. Resources are reserved, so there is no contention or queuing for packets.
   D. Data in circuit-switched networks is not subject to propagation delay.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: Because a dedicated channel is established from end-to-end, data flows without needing to wait for switch resources to become available.

Q22. What is the primary trade-off when choosing a larger value for $k$ (number of middle-stage switches) in a three-stage switch design?
   A. It decreases the total number of crosspoints but increases the chance of blocking.
   B. It increases the total number of crosspoints but decreases the chance of blocking.
   C. It decreases both the number of crosspoints and the chance of blocking.
   D. It has no effect on blocking, but it increases the number of simultaneous connections.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: A larger $k$ provides more parallel paths through the switch, reducing the probability that all paths are busy, at the cost of more hardware (crosspoints).

Q23. In an 8x8 Banyan switch, a packet arrives at an input port and is destined for output port 6 (binary 110). At the third and final stage, the microswitch will route the packet based on which bit?
   A. The high-order bit (1).
   B. The middle bit (1).
   C. The low-order bit (0).
   D. The entire address (110).

   Answer: C
   Explanation: In a switch with $\log_2(8) = 3$ stages, the third stage makes its decision based on the third (low-order) bit of the destination address.

Q24. A virtual-circuit network is described as a 'cross between a circuit-switched network and a datagram network'. Which characteristic does it share with a circuit-switched network?
   A. Each packet is treated independently by the switches.
   B. It uses setup and teardown phases to establish a path.
   C. Data is transmitted as a continuous, non-packetized flow.
   D. Resources are allocated on demand with no reservation possible.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: Like circuit-switching, a path is established before data transfer begins and is torn down afterward, creating the 'virtual circuit'.

Q25. What function is performed by the routing processor that is being moved to the input ports in newer packet switches to improve performance?
   A. Error detection and correction.
   B. Encapsulating the packet into a frame.
   C. Table lookup to determine the output port.
   D. Queuing packets before they enter the switching fabric.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: Performing the routing table search at the input port allows for faster, parallel processing and speeds up the switching decision.

Q26. In a circuit-switched network using FDM, what is reserved during the setup phase to create a dedicated path?
   A. A specific time slot in each link.
   B. A specific frequency band (channel) on each link.
   C. A Virtual-Circuit Identifier (VCI).
   D. Buffer space in each of the switches.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: In FDM, the bandwidth of a link is divided into channels, and one of these channels is dedicated to the connection on each segment of the path.
