Q1. What is the primary function of switches within a switched network?
   A. To permanently connect all devices on the network to each other.
   B. To create temporary connections between two or more devices linked to the switch.
   C. To divide messages into smaller packets for transmission.
   D. To store all network traffic for later analysis and forwarding.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source material defines switches as devices capable of creating these temporary links for one-to-one communication.


Q2. In a circuit-switched network, what is the state of network resources during the data transfer phase?
   A. Resources are allocated on-demand as data arrives at each switch.
   B. Resources are shared among all active connections on a first-come, first-served basis.
   C. Resources are reserved and dedicated to the connection for its entire duration.
   D. Resources are dynamically allocated and released based on traffic volume.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The source material emphasizes that in circuit switching, resources are reserved during setup and remain dedicated throughout the data transfer.


Q3. Which of the following is a key characteristic of a datagram network?
   A. All packets of a message must follow the same pre-established path.
   B. It requires connection setup and teardown phases for every communication.
   C. Each packet is treated independently and may travel a different path.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text explicitly lists the presence of setup and teardown phases as a characteristic shared with circuit-switched networks.


Q5. According to the source material, why are circuit-switched networks considered inefficient for computer network communication?
   A. The delay at each switch is too long due to 'store and forward' processing.
   B. Packets can arrive out of order, requiring reassembly at the destination.
   C. The connection setup phase requires complex end-to-end addressing.
   D. Allocated resources remain dedicated even when no data is being sent.

   Answer: D
   Explanation: The text highlights that a computer can be connected without activity for a long time, depriving other connections of those dedicated resources.


Q6. In a datagram network, how does a switch determine where to send an incoming packet?
   A. It sends the packet to all output ports except the one it came from.
   B. It checks a routing table using the packet's destination address.
   C. It follows the path that was established during a connection setup phase.
   D. It uses a local identifier in the packet header that points to the next switch.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text explicitly states that a switch in a datagram network uses a routing table based on the destination address to find the corresponding output port.


Q7. What is the main advantage of a circuit-switched network during the data transfer phase compared to a packet-switched network?
   A. Higher efficiency in bandwidth utilization.
   B. Greater flexibility for packets to route around congestion.
   C. Minimal delay at each switch.
   D. No need for a connection setup phase before transfer.

   Answer: C

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source material clearly states that in virtual-circuit switching, all packets follow the same path established during connection setup.


Q9. The total delay for a packet in a datagram network includes waiting time at each switch. What is the reason for this waiting time?
   A. Time is needed to establish a dedicated circuit through the switch.
   B. The switch must wait for all packets of the message to arrive before forwarding any.
   C. Resources are allocated on-demand, and a packet may have to wait if the switch is busy.
   D. The teardown signal from the previous packet must be received before the next can be sent.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text explains that resources are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning a packet may experience a wait time if other packets are being processed.


Q10. At which layer of the network model is datagram switching typically implemented?
   A. Physical Layer
   B. Data Link Layer
   C. Network Layer
   D. Transport Layer

   Explanation: The variable delay and potential for out-of-order packets in a datagram network can cause jitter and poor quality in real-time applications.


Q13. The three phases of communication in a circuit-switched network are, in order:
   A. Data Transfer, Connection Setup, Connection Teardown
   B. Connection Setup, Connection Teardown, Data Transfer
   C. Connection Setup, Data Transfer, Connection Teardown
   D. Data Transfer, Resource Reservation, Connection Teardown

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This sequence correctly reflects the process: first establish the path, then send data, then release the path.


Q14. How does resource allocation in a virtual-circuit network differ from a pure datagram network?
   A. Virtual-circuit networks cannot allocate resources on-demand.
   B. Datagram networks reserve resources for the entire duration of a message transfer.
   C. Virtual-circuit networks have the option to reserve resources during the setup phase.
   D. Datagram networks divide links into channels using FDM or TDM.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The text highlights this flexibility: resources can be allocated during setup (like circuit-switched) or on-demand (like datagram).


Q15. What does the term 'connectionless' signify in the context of a datagram network?
   A. The network devices are not physically connected to each other.
   B. The sender and receiver do not need to be online at the same time.
   C. The switch does not keep information about the connection state.
   D. No end-to-end addressing is required to send a packet.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The source directly defines connectionless as the switch not keeping state information, treating each packet as a new, independent event.


Q16. If a virtual-circuit network reserves resources during setup, how does the delay for each packet during data transfer compare?
   A. The delay is variable for each packet depending on network congestion.
   B. The delay is the same for each packet.
   C. The delay progressively increases with each subsequent packet.
   D. The first packet has a long delay, but subsequent packets have zero delay.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text notes that if resource reservation is made during setup, the delay for each packet will be the same, as there is no on-demand waiting time.


Q17. What is the role of the destination address in the header of a packet within a datagram network?
   A. It changes at each switch to point to the next hop.
   B. It is used only by the first switch to determine the entire path.
   C. It remains the same for the entire journey of the packet.
   D. It is removed after the first switch and replaced with a local circuit ID.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The source explicitly states that the destination address in the header of a datagram packet remains the same during its entire journey.


Q18. Which component is NOT part of the total delay calculation for a packet in a circuit-switched network during the data transfer phase?
   A. Propagation time
   B. Transmission time
   C. Waiting time at each switch
   D. Processing time

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The source material highlights that because resources are pre-allocated, data is not delayed (does not wait) at each switch during transfer.


Q19. In the example of the two remote offices connected by a T1 line, why are some output ports on the switches 'folded back' into the input ports?
   A. To create a redundant path between the two offices in case the T1 line fails.
   B. To allow communication between computers within the same office.
   C. To double the bandwidth available for communication to the other office.
   D. To comply with the T1 line leasing agreement from the service provider.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The solution in the example explicitly states this is done to allow communication between computers in the same office.


Q20. The 'store and forward' mechanism in packet switching implies that:
   A. A switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin transmitting it on the outbound link.
   B. A switch permanently stores a copy of every packet it forwards for backup purposes.
   C. The sending computer stores the message and waits for a forward signal from the network.
   D. The switch forwards the packet header immediately but stores the data payload for later.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This is the definition of 'store and forward': the switch stores the full packet in a buffer and then forwards it, introducing delay.


Q21. What is a primary similarity between a virtual-circuit network and a datagram network?
   A. Both require connection setup and teardown phases.
   B. In both networks, data is transmitted in the form of packets.
   C. Both guarantee that all packets will follow the same path.
   D. Both are typically implemented at the network layer.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source lists 'Data are packetized' as a characteristic of virtual-circuit networks, which it shares with datagram networks.


Q22. What happens during the 'connection teardown' phase of a circuit-switched network?
   A. The last data packet is sent with a special flag indicating the end of transmission.
   B. A signal is sent to each switch in the path to release the dedicated resources.
   C. The routing tables in the switches are updated to remove the connection entry.
   D. The switches wait for a timeout period of no activity before automatically closing the connection.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text explicitly states that a signal is sent to each switch to release the resources when one of the entities needs to disconnect.


Q23. Which type of switching is most analogous to the traditional public telephone network?
   A. Datagram packet switching
   B. Circuit switching
   C. Virtual-circuit packet switching
   D. Message switching

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source uses the telephone network as an example of circuit switching, where a dedicated circuit is set up for the conversation and then torn down.


Q24. In a datagram network, routing tables are described as being dynamic. What does this imply?
   A. The tables are set once when the switch is powered on and never change.
   B. The tables are updated periodically to reflect changes in the network.
   C. The tables are created specifically for each packet and then deleted.
   D. The tables contain information only about directly connected devices.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The source material specifies that 'The routing tables are dynamic and updated periodically,' allowing the network to adapt to changes.


Q25. Which of these is a defining difference between how a circuit-switched network and a packet-switched network handle a single communication link?
   A. Only packet-switched networks use physical links to connect switches.
   B. Circuit-switched networks divide the link into dedicated channels, while packet-switched networks do not.
   C. Packet-switched networks have a much higher propagation time on their links.
   D. Circuit-switched network links can only connect two switches, while packet-switched links can connect many.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The text states that in a circuit-switched network, 'each link is divided into n channels' (using FDM or TDM) for dedicated use, a concept absent in packet switching.


Q26. What is the consequence of packets taking different paths in a datagram network?
   A. It guarantees the most efficient use of network resources at all times.
   B. It ensures that all packets arrive at the destination with identical delay.
   C. The packets may arrive out of order and with varying delays.
   D. It simplifies the routing decision at each switch since the path is fixed.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: The example of four packets from A to X traveling different paths directly illustrates that they can arrive with different delays and potentially out of order.
