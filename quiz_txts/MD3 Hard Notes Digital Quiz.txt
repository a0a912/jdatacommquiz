Q1. In a Bipolar AMI scheme, how would the bit sequence '101101' be represented in terms of voltage levels, assuming the first '1' is represented by a positive voltage?
   A. Positive, Zero, Negative, Positive, Zero, Negative
   B. Positive, Zero, Positive, Negative, Zero, Positive
   C. Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative, Positive, Negative
   D. Zero, Positive, Zero, Zero, Positive, Zero

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This sequence correctly shows bit 0 as zero voltage and alternating polarities for consecutive bit 1s.


Q2. A digital transmission system requires a minimum quantization signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR_Q$) of 45 dB. Using the formula $SNR_Q = 6.02n_b + 1.76$, what is the minimum number of quantization levels (L) required?
   A. 128 levels
   B. 64 levels
   C. 7 levels
   D. 146 levels

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Solving for the number of bits per sample ($n_b \ge 7.18$) requires rounding up to 8 bits, which corresponds to $2^8$ levels.


Q3. Which of the following line coding schemes is most susceptible to loss of synchronization when transmitting a long sequence of '0's?
   A. Polar NRZ-L
   B. Manchester
   C. Bipolar AMI
   D. Differential Manchester

   Answer: A
   Explanation: A long sequence of zeros (or ones) results in a constant voltage level with no transitions, making it difficult for the receiver to maintain clock synchronization.


Q4. An analog signal is sampled using PCM. The maximum frequency is 10 kHz, and each sample is quantized into one of 256 levels. What is the resulting bit rate?
   A. 160,000 bps
   B. 80,000 bps
   C. 2,560,000 bps
   D. 20,000 bps

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The sampling rate is $2 \times 10$ kHz = 20,000 samples/sec. The number of bits per sample is $log_2(256) = 8$. The bit rate is $20,000 \times 8$.


Q5. Why is it impossible to determine the minimum sampling rate for a band-pass signal with a bandwidth of 200 kHz without more information?
   A. The Nyquist theorem requires the maximum frequency ($f_{max}$), which cannot be derived from the bandwidth alone.
   B. Band-pass signals cannot be digitized using Pulse Code Modulation (PCM).
   C. The sampling rate for a band-pass signal must be exactly twice its bandwidth.
   D. The bandwidth of 200 kHz is too high for modern sampling technology.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Bandwidth is the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies ($f_{max} - f_{min}$), so knowing only the bandwidth doesn't reveal the value of $f_{max}$ itself.


Q6. Compare the line coding schemes NRZ-I and Differential Manchester. What is a key similarity in how they determine the signal for the next bit?
   A. Both use the presence or absence of a transition in the signal level to represent a bit value.
   B. Both schemes guarantee a signal transition in the middle of each bit period.
   C. Both represent bit '0' with a positive voltage and bit '1' with a negative voltage.
   D. Both use three voltage levels (positive, negative, and zero) to encode data.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: NRZ-I uses a transition for bit '1', while Differential Manchester uses a transition at the start of the bit period for bit '0'. Both rely on a change (or lack thereof) rather than an absolute voltage level.


Q7. A sender transmits data at 1.5 Mbps. The receiver's clock is 0.05% faster than the sender's clock. How many extra bits does the receiver's clock sample per second?
   A. 750
   B. 75
   C. 1,500,750
   D. The receiver samples fewer bits.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: A 0.05% faster rate on 1,500,000 bps means the receiver expects $1,500,000 \times 0.0005 = 750$ extra bits per second.


Q8. In a Pseudoternary line coding scheme, what distinguishes the representation of a '0' from a '1'?
   A. Bit '1' is represented by zero voltage, while bit '0' alternates between positive and negative voltages.
   B. Bit '0' is represented by zero voltage, while bit '1' alternates between positive and negative voltages.
   C. Bit '1' is a positive voltage and bit '0' is a negative voltage.
   D. Bit '1' causes a transition at the start of the bit interval, while bit '0' does not.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This correctly defines the Pseudoternary scheme, which is effectively the inverse of the AMI convention.


Q9. Undersampling an analog signal at a rate less than the Nyquist rate ($f_s < 2f_{max}$) can lead to an effect called aliasing. What is the primary consequence of aliasing?
   A. The reconstructed signal has an incorrect frequency, providing wrong information.
   B. The reconstructed signal is a perfect but redundant copy of the original signal.
   C. The signal amplitude is reduced, resulting in a quieter signal.
   D. All high-frequency components of the signal are completely lost, leaving only silence.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Aliasing doesn't just lose information; it creates a new, misleading signal (an alias) with a frequency that was not present in the original.


Q10. Which characteristic is shared by Return-to-Zero (RZ), Manchester, and Differential Manchester encoding schemes but is absent in NRZ schemes?
   A. A signal change during each bit's interval, aiding self-synchronization.
   B. The use of three distinct voltage levels for signaling.
   C. The voltage level throughout the bit interval determines the bit's value.
   D. The absence of a voltage change represents a specific bit value.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: All three of these schemes include a mid-bit transition (RZ returns to zero, Manchester schemes transition to the opposite level) which provides timing information.


Q11. We want to digitize a low-pass audio signal with frequencies up to 22 kHz to achieve an $SNR_Q$ of at least 55 dB. What is the minimum required bit rate?
   A. 396 kbps
   B. 352 kbps
   C. 198 kbps
   D. 44 kbps

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The sampling rate is $2 \times 22,000 = 44,000$ Hz. For $SNR_Q \ge 55$ dB, $n_b$ must be at least 8.84, requiring 9 bits/sample. Bit rate is $44,000 \times 9 = 396,000$ bps.


Q12. What is the primary purpose of the quantization step in the Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) process?
   A. To approximate the amplitude of each analog sample to one of a finite set of discrete levels.
   B. To measure the analog signal's amplitude at specific, discrete points in time.
   C. To convert the discrete amplitude levels into a binary code word.
   D. To filter out unwanted frequencies from the original analog signal.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Quantization maps the continuous range of sample amplitudes to a limited number of predefined values, which is a necessary step before they can be encoded into binary.


Q13. In a unipolar NRZ scheme, the bit stream '10110' is transmitted. Which of the following voltage patterns would represent this stream?
   A. Positive, Zero, Positive, Positive, Zero
   B. Positive, Negative, Positive, Positive, Negative
   C. Positive, Zero, Negative, Positive, Zero
   D. Transition, No Transition, Transition, No Transition, Transition

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This pattern correctly maps bit '1' to a positive voltage and bit '0' to a zero voltage, with all voltages on one side of the time axis.


Q14. A polar NRZ-I signal is used to transmit data. If the current voltage level is negative, what does a transition to a positive voltage at the start of the next bit interval signify?
   A. The next bit is a '1'.
   B. The next bit is a '0'.
   C. It is the start of a synchronization sequence.
   D. An error has occurred in the transmission.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: In NRZ-I, a change in the voltage level, regardless of the direction (positive to negative or negative to positive), represents a bit '1'.


Q15. What is the fundamental trade-off introduced by increasing the number of bits per sample ($n_b$) during the quantization process?
   A. It reduces quantization error but increases the required bit rate.
   B. It increases quantization error but reduces the required bit rate.
   C. It reduces both the quantization error and the required bit rate.
   D. It has no effect on quantization error but increases the bit rate.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: More bits mean more quantization levels, leading to a more accurate representation (lower error), but also means more data must be transmitted per sample.


Q16. Which statement accurately describes the Manchester encoding scheme?
   A. It combines RZ and NRZ-L, with a voltage transition in the middle of each bit period for both data and clocking.
   B. It combines RZ and NRZ-I, where a mid-bit transition always occurs but a transition at the start of the period only happens for a bit '0'.
   C. The signal level remains constant for the duration of the bit, with positive voltage for '1' and negative for '0'.
   D. The signal returns to zero in the middle of each bit period, regardless of whether the bit is a '1' or '0'.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This correctly identifies that Manchester encoding uses a mid-bit transition to encode both the clock signal and the data value (e.g., high-to-low for '0', low-to-high for '1').


Q17. For a low-pass signal with a maximum frequency of 4 kHz, what is the effect of sampling at 7,000 samples per second?
   A. Aliasing will occur because the sampling rate is below the Nyquist rate.
   B. The original signal can be faithfully reproduced.
   C. Oversampling occurs, creating redundant data.
   D. The sampling rate is exactly the Nyquist rate, providing a good approximation.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The Nyquist rate is $2 \times 4$ kHz = 8,000 samples/sec. Since 7,000 < 8,000, undersampling occurs, leading to aliasing.


Q18. Which of the following line coding schemes uses three voltage levels but represents one of the bit values with a constant zero voltage?
   A. Bipolar AMI
   B. Polar RZ
   C. Unipolar NRZ
   D. Manchester

   Answer: A
   Explanation: AMI uses positive and negative voltages for bit '1's (alternating) and a zero voltage level for all bit '0's.


Q19. The process of digital-to-digital conversion involves line coding. What is the fundamental task performed by a line coding scheme?
   A. To convert a sequence of binary bits into a digital signal suitable for transmission.
   B. To convert an analog waveform into a sequence of binary bits.
   C. To synchronize the clocks of the sender and receiver using a separate channel.
   D. To increase the data rate of a transmission without changing the signal.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Line coding defines the rules for mapping binary data (0s and 1s) to specific voltage levels or transitions to create a transmittable digital signal.


Q20. What is quantization error in the context of PCM?
   A. The difference between the actual amplitude of a sample and the assigned discrete quantization value.
   B. An error caused by the receiver's clock being out of sync with the sender's clock.
   C. The misinterpretation of a signal's frequency due to undersampling.
   D. Noise introduced into the signal from the physical transmission medium.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Since quantization is an approximation, this error represents the loss of precision incurred when mapping a continuous value to a discrete one.


Q21. If a line coding scheme is 'self-synchronizing', what does this imply?
   A. Timing information is embedded within the data signal itself, removing the need for a separate clock.
   B. The sender and receiver clocks are perfectly matched before transmission begins and never drift.
   C. The scheme uses three voltage levels (positive, negative, zero) to ensure stability.
   D. The signal returns to a zero-voltage level after every bit, regardless of its value.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Schemes like Manchester include frequent transitions that allow the receiver to align its clock with the incoming data stream on the fly.


Q22. The human voice is to be digitized. The frequency range is 0 to 4000 Hz. If the system uses 128 distinct quantization levels, what will the final bit rate be?
   A. 56,000 bps
   B. 64,000 bps
   C. 32,000 bps
   D. 1,024,000 bps

   Answer: A
   Explanation: The sampling rate is $2 \times 4000 = 8000$ samples/sec. The number of bits per sample is $log_2(128) = 7$. The bit rate is $8000 \times 7$.


Q23. Which of the following scenarios would be best handled by a polar encoding scheme like Manchester over a bipolar scheme like AMI?
   A. A system where preventing loss of synchronization is a top priority, even with long strings of 0s or 1s.
   B. A system that requires the use of three distinct voltage levels for error detection.
   C. A legacy system designed with simpler circuitry that benefits from a zero-voltage resting state.
   D. A system where minimizing the required bandwidth is the most critical factor.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: Manchester's mandatory mid-bit transition guarantees synchronization, whereas AMI can suffer from synchronization loss during a long string of 0s.


Q24. According to the Nyquist theorem, sampling a signal at exactly twice its highest frequency ($f_s = 2f_{max}$) is sufficient for reconstruction. Why might a system intentionally use oversampling ($f_s > 2f_{max}$)?
   A. To allow for the use of simpler, less precise filters to isolate the desired frequency band.
   B. To reduce the quantization error introduced during the next step of PCM.
   C. To decrease the overall bit rate of the final digital signal.
   D. To correct for aliasing caused by a previous undersampling error.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: While not explicitly in this text, oversampling creates a larger 'guard band' in the frequency spectrum, making it easier for practical, real-world filters to remove unwanted frequencies without distorting the desired signal. The text only notes it's 'redundant and unnecessary' from a pure theoretical standpoint.


Q25. A digital signal is encoded using Differential Manchester. A sequence of transitions is observed: at the start of bit 1, there is no transition; at the start of bit 2, there is a transition; at the start of bit 3, there is a transition. What is the data sequence?
   A. 100
   B. 011
   C. 110
   D. 001

   Answer: A
   Explanation: In Differential Manchester, 'no transition' at the start of the bit period means a '1', and 'a transition' at the start of the period means a '0'.


Q26. What is the relationship between the number of quantization levels (L) and the number of bits per sample ($n_b$)?
   A. $$n_b = \log_2 L$$
   B. $$L = \log_2 n_b$$
   C. $$n_b = 2L$$
   D. $$L = 2n_b$$

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This formula correctly states that the number of bits required is the base-2 logarithm of the number of unique levels that need to be represented.
