Q1. In the context of the TCP/IP protocol suite, what is the primary reason for the existence of link-layer addressing in addition to network-layer (IP) addressing?
   A. IP addresses are not permanent and can change, while link-layer addresses are fixed for each device.
   B. Link-layer addresses are required to route datagrams across the entire Internet from the source host to the destination host.
   C. The IP address identifies the final destination, but the link-layer address is needed to move a frame to the next specific node (host or router) within a particular link.
   D. The data-link layer's error control services depend on link-layer addresses to function correctly, unlike the network layer.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This correctly identifies the distinct roles: IP addresses for the end-to-end path and link-layer addresses for the immediate, single-hop delivery.

Q2. When a router receives a frame, it performs decapsulation and encapsulation. Why is this process necessary even if the incoming and outgoing links use the same data-link protocol?
   A. To change the source and destination IP addresses within the datagram.
   B. To update the frame's header with the new source and destination link-layer addresses for the next hop.
   C. To allow the router to perform flow control on the datagram.
   D. To split the datagram into smaller frames if the next link has a smaller maximum frame size.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: Even with the same protocol, the frame must be addressed to the specific next node on the next link, which requires changing the link-layer addresses.

Q3. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map an IP address to a link-layer address. Why is it generally inefficient to send the actual data datagram in a broadcast frame to find the destination, instead of using an ARP request first?
   A. Broadcasting data datagrams is prohibited by all data-link layer protocols.
   B. Using ARP allows the sending host to cache the mapping, avoiding broadcasts for subsequent packets to the same destination.
   C. ARP packets are smaller than data datagrams, which reduces network traffic during the broadcast.
   D. Only the ARP protocol is capable of receiving a unicast reply; a broadcast datagram would not elicit a response.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This highlights the core efficiency gain: one initial broadcast for ARP allows many subsequent data packets to be sent via unicast, saving network resources and processing time on other nodes.

Q4. According to the textbook's example, when a datagram travels from Alice to Bob via routers R1 and R2, which of the following address pairs changes at each hop?
   A. The source IP address and the source link-layer address.
   B. The destination IP address and the destination link-layer address.
   C. The source and destination link-layer addresses.
   D. The source and destination IP addresses.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: For each link (Alice-to-R1, R1-to-R2, R2-to-Bob), a new frame is created with the link-layer addresses of the sender and receiver on that specific link.

Q5. The data-link layer can be conceptually divided into the Data Link Control (DLC) and Media Access Control (MAC) sublayers. A network link consisting of the shared airwaves for cellular communication would require functionalities from which sublayer(s)?
   A. Primarily the DLC sublayer, as it handles framing and flow control.
   B. Primarily the MAC sublayer, as the main challenge is coordinating access among many users.
   C. Neither, as wireless communication is handled by the physical layer.
   D. Both the DLC and MAC sublayers.

   Answer: D
   Explanation: As a broadcast link, it needs the MAC sublayer to manage shared access, and the DLC sublayer for common functions like framing applicable to all link types.

Q6. In an ARP request packet, the 'destination hardware address' field is typically filled with zeros. Why is this the case?
   A. It signals to the network that this is a request packet, not a reply.
   B. This value acts as a placeholder because the sender does not yet know the hardware address it is seeking.
   C. It is a special address that forces the receiving node to check its cache before replying.
   D. The destination hardware address is instead placed in the data-link frame header.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The very purpose of the ARP request is to discover this unknown hardware address, so the field is left empty or set to a null value like all zeros.

Q7. A router has interfaces connected to three different networks. How many link-layer addresses and IP addresses will this router have?
   A. One IP address and three link-layer addresses.
   B. One IP address and one link-layer address.
   C. Three IP addresses and one link-layer address.
   D. Three IP addresses and three link-layer addresses.

   Answer: D
   Explanation: Each interface is a connection point to a link and requires its own pair of addresses: an IP address for the network layer and a link-layer address for the data-link layer.

Q8. When router R1 in the Alice-to-Bob example needs to send the datagram to router R2, what information does it look up in its forwarding table, and what is the result?
   A. It looks up Bob's link-layer address (LB) and finds the next-hop link-layer address (L3).
   B. It looks up Bob's IP address (NB) and finds the next-hop IP address (N3).
   C. It looks up Alice's IP address (NA) and finds the outgoing interface's IP address (N2).
   D. It looks up the incoming link-layer address (LA) and finds the outgoing link-layer address (L3).

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The router uses the final destination IP address (NB) to determine the IP address of the next router in the path (N3), which it then uses for ARP.

Q9. Which of the following services is generally considered an issue for the network or transport layers rather than the data-link layer, despite potentially affecting links?
   A. Framing
   B. Flow Control
   C. Error Control
   D. Congestion Control

   Answer: D
   Explanation: The text states that due to its end-to-end nature, congestion control is typically handled by the network or transport layers, not directly by most data-link protocols.

Q10. What is the key difference between a unicast, multicast, and broadcast link-layer address?
   A. Unicast is for hosts, multicast is for routers, and broadcast is for switches.
   B. Unicast is for one-to-one, multicast is for one-to-many, and broadcast is for one-to-all communication on a link.
   C. Unicast addresses are 48 bits, multicast are 24 bits, and broadcast are 12 bits.
   D. Unicast is used on point-to-point links, while multicast and broadcast are used on shared links.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This correctly defines the communication pattern for each address type: one specific device, a specific group of devices, or every device on the link.

Q11. An ARP reply is sent as a unicast frame. How does the replying node (System B) know the specific link-layer address to send the reply to (System A)?
   A. It uses the broadcast address, and System A is programmed to accept it.
   B. It extracts the sender's link-layer and IP addresses from the incoming ARP request packet.
   C. It performs its own ARP request for System A's IP address.
   D. It looks up System A's IP address in its own forwarding table to find the link-layer address.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The ARP request packet contains the source hardware (link-layer) address of the sender, which the recipient uses as the destination for the unicast reply.

Q12. Communication at the data-link layer is described as node-to-node. In the context of the internet, what constitutes a 'node' and a 'link'?
   A. A node is an application process, and a link is the transport layer connection between them.
   B. A node is a TCP/IP protocol suite, and a link is the physical hardware.
   C. Nodes are end hosts and routers, and links are the networks (LANs and WANs) that connect them.
   D. Nodes are physical cables and wireless signals, and a link is a router that joins them.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This aligns perfectly with the textbook's definition, where devices that process packets are nodes and the communication paths between them are links.

Q13. At which point in the communication path from Alice to Bob does a device need to perform both decapsulation and encapsulation at the data-link layer?
   A. Only at Alice's computer (the source).
   B. Only at Bob's computer (the destination).
   C. At an intermediate router like R1 or R2.
   D. At all nodes in the path, including the source and destination.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: A router must decapsulate the frame to read the datagram for a forwarding decision and then encapsulate the datagram into a new frame for the next link.

Q14. What distinguishes a point-to-point link from a broadcast link at the data-link layer?
   A. Point-to-point links use IP addresses, while broadcast links use MAC addresses.
   B. A point-to-point link has a dedicated capacity between two devices, whereas a broadcast link's capacity is shared among multiple devices.
   C. Point-to-point links are always wired, and broadcast links are always wireless.
   D. Point-to-point links are managed by the DLC sublayer, while broadcast links are managed by the MAC sublayer.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This correctly captures the core distinction: dedicated versus shared access to the communication medium.

Q15. According to Figure 9.5, the link-layer address order in the frame header is 'destination-source', while the IP address order in the datagram header is 'source-destination'. What is the implication of this for the frame sent from Router R1 to Router R2?
   A. The frame header contains L5 then L4, and the datagram header contains N1 then N8.
   B. The frame header contains L4 then L5, and the datagram header contains N1 then N8.
   C. The frame header contains L5 then L4, and the datagram header contains N2 then N3.
   D. The frame header contains L2 then L3, and the datagram header contains N1 then N8.

   Answer: A
   Explanation: This correctly applies the specified address ordering for Link 2, where L5 is the destination and L4 is the source link-layer address, while the end-to-end IP addresses N1 and N8 remain unchanged.

Q16. If Bob's computer is turned off when router R2 sends an ARP request to find Bob's link-layer address (LB), what will happen?
   A. Router R2 will receive an ARP reply from another device on the link on Bob's behalf.
   B. Router R2 will send the frame using the broadcast link-layer address instead.
   C. Router R2 will not receive an ARP reply, and it will be unable to create and send the frame to Bob.
   D. Router R2 will use the destination IP address (NB) as the link-layer address.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: Since Bob's machine cannot respond, the ARP request will time out, and the datagram cannot be delivered across that final link.

Q17. The text mentions that a unicast link-layer address for Ethernet is 48 bits, represented as 12 hexadecimal digits. What is the significance of the second hexadecimal digit in determining if an Ethernet address is multicast?
   A. It must be an odd number for a multicast address.
   B. It must be 'F' for a multicast address.
   C. It has no special significance; any 48-bit address can be multicast.
   D. It must be an even number for a multicast address.

   Answer: D
   Explanation: This aligns with the rule described in Example 9.2, which is based on the least significant bit of the first byte (represented by this digit) being set to 1 to indicate a multicast address.

Q18. In the communication example (Figures 9.11-9.14), how does Alice's computer initially determine the IP address of the first-hop router (N1)?
   A. It sends a broadcast ARP request for the address of 'the default router'.
   B. The network layer consults its local routing/forwarding table.
   C. It is provided by Bob's computer in a preliminary handshake.
   D. It uses the DNS protocol to look up the router's IP address.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: A host's routing table contains information about its local network and, crucially, the IP address of the default gateway (router) for all non-local traffic.

Q19. Why does the text state that the TCP/IP protocol suite does not define any protocols in the data-link or physical layers?
   A. Because these layers are considered obsolete in modern networking.
   B. Because the functions of these layers have been absorbed into the network layer.
   C. Because TCP/IP is designed to run over many different network technologies, each with its own data-link and physical layer standards.
   D. Because data-link and physical layer protocols are proprietary and not part of any open standard.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: This architectural choice allows the Internet (using TCP/IP) to connect a wide variety of underlying networks (like Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.) without being tied to a single technology.

Q20. In the ARP packet format (Figure 9.8), what is the purpose of the 'Protocol Type' and 'Hardware Type' fields?
   A. To specify the version of the ARP protocol being used.
   B. To allow ARP to be used with different network-layer protocols (like IPv4) and different link-layer technologies (like Ethernet).
   C. To define the priority of the ARP request on the network.
   D. To indicate whether the packet is a request or a reply.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This correctly identifies their purpose: to make ARP flexible enough to map, for example, IPv4 addresses to Ethernet MAC addresses, or other combinations.

Q21. What would be the most likely consequence if the data-link layer did not provide the 'framing' service?
   A. The network would become congested with too many small packets.
   B. The physical layer would be unable to convert data to signals.
   C. The receiving node would see a continuous stream of bits without any way to discern where one datagram ends and the next begins.
   D. IP addresses would be unable to route the packets to their final destination.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: Framing provides the necessary delimiters (like headers and trailers) that allow the receiver to identify and extract individual datagrams from the bitstream.

Q22. In the Alice-to-Bob example, router R2's forwarding table maps Bob's IP address (NB) to Bob's IP address (NB). What does this entry signify?
   A. That the router has made an error and is in a routing loop.
   B. That Bob is directly connected to one of the router's interfaces.
   C. That the router does not know how to reach Bob and will drop the packet.
   D. That Bob's computer is also acting as a router.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: When the next hop for a destination is the destination itself, it means the destination is on a local link, and the packet can be delivered directly rather than forwarded to another router.

Q23. Why might a house at a street corner with two gates serve as a good analogy for a router with multiple interfaces and IP addresses?
   A. Because the house has a single overall address, just like a router has one main IP address.
   B. Because each gate provides a connection point to a different street (link), and each has an address corresponding to that street.
   C. Because a person inside the house (the datagram) does not change, but the gate used to exit (the frame) does.
   D. Because both gates lead to the same destination, just via different paths.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: This captures the essence of a router: each interface is a connection to a different network (street) and requires a unique address on that network.

Q24. A host sends an ARP request. If the target host is on a different network, who will send the ARP reply?
   A. The target host itself, after the request is forwarded by the router.
   B. The router on the sending host's local network.
   C. No one will reply, and the packet will be dropped.
   D. All routers on the path to the destination will reply.

   Answer: B
   Explanation: The sending host will use ARP to find the link-layer address of its default router, and the router will reply with its own link-layer address, not the final destination's.

Q25. The textbook states, 'Communication at the data-link layer is made up of five separate logical connections' for the path shown in Figure 9.1. What does 'logical connection' mean in this context?
   A. A permanent circuit established between each pair of nodes before data is sent.
   B. A direct physical wire connecting each pair of adjacent nodes.
   C. The end-to-end transport layer connection between Alice and Bob.
   D. The protocol-based interaction for delivering a frame between two adjacent nodes across a single link.

   Answer: D
   Explanation: Each hop (e.g., Alice-to-R1, R1-to-R2) is a distinct communication instance at the data-link layer, treated as a separate 'connection' for delivering one frame.

Q26. If a data-link protocol does not implement flow control, what is the most likely outcome when a fast sender transmits frames to a slow receiver on the same link?
   A. The sender will automatically slow down due to physical layer feedback.
   B. The network layer will request retransmission of all frames.
   C. The receiver's buffer will overflow, and incoming frames will be dropped.
   D. The link itself will become congested, preventing any further transmission.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: Without a mechanism to signal the sender to slow down, the receiver will be overwhelmed and forced to discard frames it cannot process.

Q27. Considering the entire journey from Alice to Bob, where is the information contained in the forwarding table of a router (like R1 or R2) used?
   A. It is used by the data-link layer to create the frame header.
   B. It is used by the physical layer to modulate the signal.
   C. It is used by the network layer to determine the IP address of the next hop.
   D. It is used by the application layer at the final destination to reassemble the message.

   Answer: C
   Explanation: After decapsulating the datagram, the router's network layer consults its forwarding table using the destination IP address to decide where to send the datagram next.
